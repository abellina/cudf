/**
 * This class supports start/end NVTX profiling ranges or "unscoped" ranges.
 *
 * Start/end:
 *
 * The constructor instantiates a new NVTX range and keeps a handle that comes back from the
 * NVTX api (nvtxRangeId) that used to later close such a range. This type of range does 
 * not have the same order-of-operation requirements that the push/pop ranges have: 
 * the `NvtxUnscopedRange` instance can be passed to other scopes, and even to other threads
 * for the eventual call to close.
 *
 * It can be used in the same try-with-resources way as push/pop, or interleaved with other
 * ranges, like so:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   NvtxUnscopedRange a = new NvtxUnscopedange("a", NvtxColor.RED);
 *   NvtxUnscopedRange b = new NvtxUnscopedange("b", NvtxColor.BLUE);
 *   a.close();
 *   b.close();
 * </pre>
 *
 * Start/end ranges are different in that they don't have the same correlation that the
 * push/pop ranges have.
